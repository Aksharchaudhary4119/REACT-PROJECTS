            Encapsulation
        </summary>

        <p>wrapping the data into a singale unit its done through the class, class is an example of Encapsulation</p>
        <p>class is a collaction of datamember and member Function only</p>
        <p>without instance of class we are not able to access the property of class at out side of the class</p>
        <p>Instant = Object</p>
        <p>let objecVar = New className </p>
        <p>with the help of class we are providing basic lavel of securety to our code</p>
        <h4>Pros:</h4>
        <p>classes can make your code more modular and easier to understand.</p>
        <p>classes support inheritance, which allows you to create more specialized objects that shre some of the same
            Functionality as the base class.</p>
        <p>classes can help to oragnize your code and make it more rfficient.</p>
        <h4>Cons:</h4>
        <p>clsses can make your code more complex, which can make it more difficult to understand, debug, and maintain.
        </p>
        <p>classes are not as flexible as other programming constructs, such as Function and prototypes, wich can make
            them difficult to use in certain situations. </p>
        <p>classes may not be suitable for all types of project,depending on the specific requirements and goal odf the
            project</p>
