            Question and Answer

        <h3>1. How do you create an object in JavaScript?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Create a single object, using an object literal.</li>
                <li>Create a single object, with the keyword new .</li>
                <li>Define an object constructor, and then create objects of the constructed type.</li>
                <li>Create an object using Object.create() .</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. What is the ‘this’ keyword in JavaScript?</h3>
            <p>“This” keyword refers to an object that is executing the current piece of code. It references the object that is executing the current function. If the function being referenced is a regular function, “this” references the global object.</p>

            <h3>3. What are object prototypes?</h3>
            <p>Prototypes are the mechanism by which JavaScript objects inherit features from one another.</p>

            <h3>4. Use of a constructor function (with examples)</h3>
            <p>//Constructor function User (name, age) { this.name = name; this. age = age; } var user1 = new User('Bob', 25); var user2 = new User('Alice', 27); In the above example, arguments are passed to the constructor during object creation. This allows each object to have different property values.</p>

            <h3>5. Prototypal vs Classical Inheritance</h3>
            <p>In classical inheritance, Animal is a class, Dog is a subclass of Animal , and suzanna is an instance of a Dog . In prototypal inheritance, there's no class. You have an animal , which is an object. A dog is another object, which clones and extends animal (the prototype object).</p>
