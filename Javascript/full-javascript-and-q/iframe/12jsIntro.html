    <h1>1.what is javascript</h1>
    <p>Ans = (JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.)</p>
   <p>Ans = (JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform, single-threaded, and interpreted compiled programming language. It is also known as the scripting language for webpages. It is well-known for the development of web pages, and many non-browser environments also use it.)</p>
    <p>Ans = Our JavaScript Tutorial is designed for beginners and professionals both. JavaScript is used to create client-side dynamic pages.
        
        JavaScript is an object-based scripting language which is lightweight and cross-platform.
        
        JavaScript is not a compiled language, but it is a translated language. The JavaScript Translator (embedded in the browser) is responsible for translating the JavaScript code for the web browser</p>
        <p>Ans = JavaScript is a single-threaded, synchronous programming and scripting language. It is widely used in the field of web development. it can be used in the front end and backend. Also, JavaScript is not a compiled language, it gets interpreted through a web browser   </p>
        <p>Ans = (JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is widely used for creating interactive web pages and web applications. It was first introduced in 1995 by Brendan Eich. JavaScript is a lightweight language that can be embedded in HTML and is compatible with all major web browsers.
            
            JavaScript is an object-oriented language that is easy to learn and has a vast community of developers who share resources, tutorials, and libraries to help beginners. It is dynamically typed, meaning that variables can change their data type at runtime, which can lead to unexpected behavior and bugs in the code.
            
            In short words, JavaScript is a versatile programming language that is essential for creating dynamic and interactive websites and web applications.)</p>
            <p>Ans = (JavaScript is a programming language used primarily for web development. Learning the basics of JavaScript is fairly simple. However, this language is highly interactive and has many complex features and nuances when used at an advanced level. As projects become more reliant on JavaScript, employers increasingly seek out candidates with strong JavaScript skills. In this article, we explain what JavaScript is, its uses and advantages and how to begin developing JavaScript skills to advance in your career.)</p>

        Question And Answer
    </summary>

    <h2>1. What do you understand about JavaScript?</h2>
   <pre>
    JavaScript is a versatile and widely-used programming language primarily used for building dynamic and interactive web pages. Here's what you
     should know about JavaScript:

    1. Client-side scripting**: JavaScript is primarily executed on the client-side, meaning it runs in the user's web browser rather than on the
     web server. It enables dynamic interaction with web pages, allowing for things like form validation, animation, and updating page content without
      reloading the entire page.
    
    2. High-level, interpreted language**: JavaScript is a high-level language, meaning it is human-readable and easy to understand. It's also an
     interpreted language, meaning it doesn't need to be compiled into machine code before execution; instead, the browser's JavaScript engine interprets
      and executes the code.
    
    3. Multi-paradigm**: JavaScript supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming styles.
     This flexibility allows developers to choose the approach that best fits their needs and coding preferences.
    
    4. Event-driven and asynchronous**: JavaScript is inherently event-driven, meaning it responds to user actions and events such as clicks, mouse 
    movements, and keyboard inputs. It also supports asynchronous programming, allowing tasks to be executed concurrently without blocking the main execution thread.
    
    5. DOM manipulation**: JavaScript provides powerful APIs for manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) of web pages. This enables developers to
     dynamically update the content, structure, and style of web pages in response to user interactions or other events.
    
    6. Rich ecosystem and libraries**: JavaScript has a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, such as React, Angular, and Vue.js, that streamline
     development tasks and provide pre-built solutions for common challenges. Additionally, there are numerous third-party libraries and packages available via 
     tools like npm (Node Package Manager).
    
    7. Cross-platform compatibility**: JavaScript is supported by all major web browsers, making it a cross-platform language. This means that JavaScript
     code written for one browser will generally work in other browsers as well, ensuring broad compatibility for web applications.
    
    8. **Server-side development**: While traditionally associated with client-side web development, JavaScript has also gained popularity for server-side
     development with platforms like Node.js. This allows developers to use JavaScript for both client and server-side components of web applications, enabling 
     full-stack development with a single language.
    
    Overall, JavaScript's versatility, ease of use, and extensive ecosystem make it a popular choice for web development, powering many of the interactive 
    features and functionalities found on the modern web.

    <h2>3. What are the features of JavaScript?</h2>

    <pre>
        JavaScript is a versatile and dynamic programming language with a wide range of features that make it suitable for various applications,
         particularly in web development. Some key features of JavaScript include:

1. **Interactivity**: JavaScript enables interactivity on web pages by allowing developers to respond to user actions such as clicks, mouse movements,
 and keyboard inputs. This makes web applications more engaging and responsive.

2. **Dynamic Typing**: JavaScript is dynamically typed, meaning variables are not bound to specific data types. This flexibility allows for more fluid 
coding and easier prototyping but also requires careful attention to type handling to prevent runtime errors.

3. **Prototype-based Object Orientation**: JavaScript uses a prototype-based object-oriented programming model, where objects inherit properties and 
behaviors directly from other objects. This differs from class-based languages like Java or C++, offering more flexibility in object creation and manipulation.

4. **Functions as First-Class Citizens**: In JavaScript, functions are treated as first-class citizens, meaning they can be assigned to variables, passed 
as arguments to other functions, and returned as values from functions. This feature enables powerful functional programming techniques and higher-order functions.

5. **Asynchronous Programming**: JavaScript supports asynchronous programming through mechanisms like callbacks, promises, and async/await syntax. This allows
 non-blocking execution of code, making it well-suited for tasks such as handling network requests, file I/O, and user input.

6. **DOM Manipulation**: JavaScript provides powerful APIs for manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) of web pages. Developers can dynamically update the
 structure, content, and style of web pages in response to user interactions or other events.

7. **Browser Compatibility**: JavaScript is supported by all major web browsers, making it a cross-platform language. This ensures that JavaScript code written 
for one browser will generally work in other browsers as well, ensuring broad compatibility for web applications.

8. **Extensive Ecosystem**: JavaScript has a vast ecosystem of libraries, frameworks, and tools that streamline development tasks and provide pre-built solutions
 for common challenges. Popular frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js are widely used for building modern web applications.

9. **Server-side Development**: With platforms like Node.js, JavaScript can be used for server-side development, enabling full-stack development with a single 
language. This allows developers to use JavaScript for both client and server-side components of web applications.

10. **Community Support and Resources**: JavaScript has a large and active community of developers, providing ample resources, tutorials, forums, and open-source
 projects to support learning and development efforts.

These features make JavaScript a powerful and versatile programming language for building dynamic and interactive web applications.

    <h2>4. What are the advantages of JavaScript over other web technologies?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li value="1"><b><strong>Saves time and bandwidth:</strong></b><span> Regardless of where you host JavaScript, it always gets executed on the client environment to save lots of bandwidth and make the execution process fast.</span></li>
            <li value="2"><b><strong>Easily send HTTP requests:</strong></b><span> In JavaScript, XMLHttpRequest is an important object that was designed by Microsoft. The object calls made by XMLHttpRequest as an asynchronous HTTP request to the server to transfer the data to both sides without reloading the page</span></li>
            <li value="3"><b><strong>Compatible for all browsers:</strong></b><span> The biggest advantage of JavaScript having the ability to support all modern browsers and produce an equivalent result.</span></li>
            <li value="4"><b><strong>Community Support:</strong></b><span> Global companies support community development by creating important projects. An example is Google (created the </span><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-angularjs/"><b><strong>Angular framework</strong></b></a><span>) or Facebook (created the </span><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/react-js-introduction-working/"><b><strong>React.js</strong></b></a><span> framework).</span></li>
            <li value="5"><b><strong>Vastly used:</strong></b><span> JavaScript is employed everywhere on the web.</span></li>
            <li value="6"><b><strong>Environment Support:</strong></b><span> JavaScript plays nicely with other languages and may be utilized in an enormous sort of application.</span></li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li value="1"><span>This may be difficult to develop large applications, although you’ll also use the TypeScript overlay.</span></li>
            <li value="2"><span>This applies to larger front-end projects. The configuration is often a tedious task due to the number of tools that are required to figure together to make an environment for such a project. This is often directly associated with the library’s operation.</span></li>
            <li value="3"><span>The main problem or disadvantage in JavaScript is that the code is always visible to everyone anyone can view JavaScript code.</span></li>
            <li value="4"><span>No matter what proportion fast JavaScript interprets, JavaScript DOM (Document Object Model) is slow and can be a never-fast rendering with HTML.</span></li>
