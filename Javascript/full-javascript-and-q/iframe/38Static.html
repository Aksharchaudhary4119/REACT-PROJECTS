    <p> The static keyword defines a static method or field for a class, or a static initialization block (see the link for more information about this usage). Static properties cannot be directly accessed on instances of the class. Instead, they're accessed on the class itself.</p>
    <p> Static methods are often utility functions, such as functions to create or clone objects, whereas static properties are useful for caches, fixed-configuration, or any other data you don't need to be replicated across instances.</p>
